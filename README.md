# okd-deployer

- first edit the inventory!
- then get a wildcard certificate for your proposed master (like frodo.pflaeging.net and *.frodo.pflaewging.net)
    - be sure that every certificate file ends with a newline (this is NOT true for my letsencrypt certs!)
- than take all the scripts from 1- to 7-
- after this, you've got a running OKD cluster

Fun ;-)
