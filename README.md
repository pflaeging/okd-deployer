# okd-deployer

- first edit the inventory and environment.sh!
- then get a wildcard certificate for your proposed master (like *.rohan.pfpk.pro)
    - be sure that every certificate file ends with a newline (this is NOT true for my letsencrypt certs!)
- prepare a htpasswd file with htpasswd
- than take all the scripts from 1- to 7-
- after this, you've got a running OKD cluster

Fun ;-)
